"""
utils/seed_manager.py — Deterministic, paired seed handling.

RULES (locked decisions):
  - Env seed for run index r:  env_seed = BASE_SEED + r * SEED_STRIDE.
    All methods share the SAME env seed per run index (paired at map level).
  - Per-agent policy seed: derived deterministically from env_seed + agent_id,
    so each agent has its own independent RNG stream.
  - Policy seeds are NOT identical across methods: internal policy randomness
    (tie-breaking etc.) is free to differ, as agreed (limitation D1).
